  # heFFTe depends on MPI, but we do not yet build a Windows-MPI that we trust
  skip: true  # [win]

  # add build string so packages can depend on specific mpi variants
  # dependencies:
  # `pkg * mpi_mpich_*` for MPICH
  # `pkg * mpi_openmpi_*` for OpenMPI
  # `pkg * mpi_*` for any mpi
  {% set mpi_prefix = "mpi_" + mpi %}                   # [not win]
  string: {{ mpi_prefix }}_h{{ PKG_HASH }}_{{ build }}  # [not win]

requirements:
  build:
    - {{ compiler("c") }}
    - {{ compiler("cxx") }}
    - {{ stdlib("c") }}
    - cmake
    - make  # [unix]
    # In OpenMPI, the compiler wrappers are binaries and the wrappers in build
    # can use host libraries by adding OPAL_PREFIX and in mpich, compiler
    # wrappers are bash scripts and wrappers in build can't use host libraries.
    - {{ mpi }}  # [not win and build_platform != target_platform and mpi == "openmpi"]    - pkg-config

  summary: Distributed fast-Fourier transforms in on a heterogeneous systems.

  description: |
    The Highly Efficient FFT for Exascale (heFFTe) library is being developed
    as part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), which is a joint project
    of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science and National Nuclear
    Security Administration (NNSA). HeFFTe delivers algorithms for distributed
    fast-Fourier transforms in on a heterogeneous systems, targeting the
    upcoming exascale machines.
